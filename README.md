# splunk-input.conf

Open a command prompt or PowerShell window.
Change the directory to the %SPLUNK_HOME%\etc\system\local directory on your Splunk platform instance.
Edit the inputs.conf configuration file in this directory. You might need to create the file if it doesn't already exist.
Add inputs to the inputs.conf file by defining input stanzas, settings, and values.
Save the file and close it.
Restart the Splunk platform instance.
The software reloads the configuration files and begins collecting data based on the new configuration.
